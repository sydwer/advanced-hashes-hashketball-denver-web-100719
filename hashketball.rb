#most points is same as above basically or use original idea of form hash/array/good time and search/find your way to victory(which is sooooo ineffcient)
#winning team = form array of :points values, add em up, compare and return the biggest ones correspongsing value 
# longest boy is add strings to array, e.g split those boys up, sort those suckers and give me array[-1] or reverse it then give me array[0] if its asking for longest name- if it wants to see if they steala lot id need to create a metric for that comparison? or is aslking if the dude with the longest name does steal a ton?
